// First, it checks if the height array has at least three bars, as trapping water is not possible with fewer bars.

// Initialize two pointers, left and right, to point to the first and last bars in the elevation map.

// Initialize two variables, leftMax and rightMax, to keep track of the maximum elevation encountered from the left and right sides.

// Initialize waterTrapped to 0 to keep track of the total trapped water.

// Use a while loop that continues until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.

// In each iteration, check whether the elevation at the left or right pointer is lower. If height[left] is lower, it means you're considering the left side, and vice versa.

// Update the leftMax or rightMax accordingly, depending on whether the current elevation is greater than the corresponding maximum elevation encountered so far.

// Calculate and add the amount of water trapped between the current left and right positions to the waterTrapped variable.

// Move the pointer (either left or right) towards the other direction.

// Repeat the process until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer.

// Return the waterTrapped, which represents the total amount of water that can be trapped.
